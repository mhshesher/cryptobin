# CryptoBin
**Cryptobin** is an android application that converts your text into a encrypted binary text that can only be decrypted by **Cryptobin**. Instead of traditional encryption rules, it follows an algorithm implemented by the developer.

## Features
1. You can encrypt any text.
2. You can decrypt any encrypted text that was encrypted by **CryptoBin**
3. You can copy both encrypted and decrypted text and paste it anywhere you want.
4. You can paste any copied text into **Cryptobin** to encrypt or decrypt it.

## Conclusion
Personally I am interested in playing with encryption. I developed this application from my personal interest. There is no business plan with this application.
